          <h2>Dhruv Singh</h2>
          <h3>San Francisco, CA</h3>
          <p>
            Dhruv is a sought after DJ and dancer in the west coast known for playing inspiring tangos, soaring valses, fun milongas and energizing cortinas. His passion for tango is infectious and he clearly brings that out while DJing. Dhruv regularly DJs in San Francisco milongas and in marathons/festivals nationally.

          <h2>Kim Dai</h2>
          <h3>New York, NY</h3>
          <p>
            Kim was initially drawn to tango by the music, before she fell in love with the dance. She is curious about the wide range of emotional expression that tango allows for and loves how the music inspires her to connect more deeply to herself and others through that shared experience. As a DJ, she aims to share her passion by creating different moods and vibes with her music; encouraging dancers to explore their own emotional depths while connecting to something greater than themselves. She finds it magical when the music is able to enter into the embrace and flow through the couple. Kim currently co-hosts and DJs at a weekly milonga, Gallo Ciego, and a weekly practica, Tuesday Practica, in New York City.

          <h2>Lampis Zalavras</h2>
          <h3>Los Angeles, CA</h3>
          <p>
            Lampis has been fascinated by tango for two decades and continuously tries to expand his understanding of this complex art form. Playing the right tanda at the right time is critical for an emotionally fulfilling evening of dancing and he aims to achieve exactly that with his music selections. Lampis focuses on traditional music that keeps the dancers on the floor until the very end of the milonga. He is based in Los Angeles and has been regularly DJing in multiple events all over the world.

          <h2>Ramu Pyreddy</h2>
          <h3>Washington, DC</h3>
          <p>
            Ramu fell in love with tango music in 1999 and started dancing in 2000. To share that love and budding passion, in 2000, he started the Michigan Argentine Tango Club at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. 25 years later, he still remains deeply in love (if anything it has only grown stronger). Along the way, he has become one of the most knowledgeable and sought after tango DJ’s in the US. He has DJd at countless events – milongas, festivals and marathons – all over the US, in Argentina, Australia, Canada, and India. For the last 14+ years, he has been the host and resident DJ at Milonga Zandunga, one of DC’s popular weekly milongas, known for it’s outstanding music. As a DJ, Ramu plays mostly music from the Golden Age and has a strong preference for the Big Four Orchestras

          <h2>Sabah Chammas</h2>
          <h3>San Diego, CA</h3>
          <p>
            Sabah got addicted to Tango in the late nineties. It started with dancing and now it includes being a DJ.
            “…Tango music occupies my thoughts and energizes my spirit and I am in constant search of good music. Although I try to vary the music I play, please feel free to consider me old fashioned as I love Golden age music. The emotional impact of the music is what I look for in addition to the musicality.”

          <h2>Yelizaveta Nersesova</h2>
          <h3>Los Angeles, CA</h3>
          <p>
            I’ve been DJing since 2015, and my strategy is built around contrast and curation. I alternate between Guardia Vieja, Milonguero, and Salon-style orchestras so that dancers experience a full range of textures, moods, and phrasing. Think of it like a well-balanced menu: I aim to serve something satisfying for every musical palate. Whether you crave the deep nostalgia of Canaro, the pulse of D’Arienzo, or the lyrical elegance of Caló, I want each tanda to spark a new appetite—and keep you dancing.
